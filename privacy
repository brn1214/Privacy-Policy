Usage Data: To provide the core features of the App, we store your reading progress, such as the last-read position in a book and your reading statistics (e.g., words per minute).
Settings Data: We store your preferences, such as your configured reading speed (WPM).
Important: All Usage Data and Settings Data are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party by the App itself.
